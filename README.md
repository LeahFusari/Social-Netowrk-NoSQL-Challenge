# Social-Netowrk-NoSQL-Challenge
  
  ## Description 
    This challenge is a backend NoSQL database assignment using MongoDB, Mongoose, Node and Express.  We were to create Models, Schema, and API routes using the MongoDB/Mongoose methods.  
    
    The NoSQL database is a lot less rigid with it's Model associations and references, therefore making it more agile to updates based on the client's needs.

  ## User Story
    AS A social media startup
    I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
    SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

  ## Installation 

    You will need to run `npm i` to install Express, Mongoose and mongoose-type-email for the email validation.

  ## Usage 

  Since this is a backend only application, you will need to use insomnia to test the routes.
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN a social network API
    WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
    WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
    WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
    WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
